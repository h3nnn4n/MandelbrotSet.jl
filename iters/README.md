The mandelbrot set is made out of all points in the complex plane for which z -> zÂ² + c stays bounded in a circle of radius 2.

As one zooms in the set it becomes harder and harder to determine if a point is in the set or not.
Except for the main bulb and a few ones there is no other way to find out than to simply iterate.

The 10 images in the folder show how the number of iterations afects the decision of if a point is in the set or not. Black points *are* in the set.

Below is the name of the image and the number of iterations used.

1  |  1200
2  |  3000
3  |  5000
4  |  7000
5  |  10000
6  |  15000
7  |  20000
8  |  25000
9  |  37500
10 |  50000

The quality of the images quickly degrades as the iterations go up because the code I wrote sucks.
